# Herart-Disease-Prediction
Our project employs machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of heart disease. We used a dataset containing medical records of patients with and without heart disease. The model was trained on a range of features, including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.
